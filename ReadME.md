# LAB 8

Create an authentication system that allows to

- login a user stored in a database using 2 factor authentication system (2FA)

- - using a mobile app (for example google authenticator)
  - or email
  - or sms

Test the system and upload a link to the source code snippet and a screenshot from **Google Authenticator**.
You can use PHPSandbox for backend, or any other service or technology. You can extend L7 with 2FA.

### COMMENT

Google Authenticator doesn't allow to do a screenshot.

Anyway I downloaded "google authenticator" app from my play store and I scan the QR code that the page gives. Then, the app shows the code to insert in input box on authentication page. This code must be entered as soon as possible because it changes very quickly. If the code entered is incorrect, the code returns to the login page and after re-entering the credentials, the page with the QR code is shown again with a message informing the user that an incorrect code was previously entered.

**THE CODE:**
