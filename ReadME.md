# LAB 9

Create a RBAC system that restricts a page to specific actions per role using JWT (for example GET the resource for all authenticated users, and POST only for admins).

You can use PHPSandbox for backend, or any other service or technology, and any type of HTTP client technology.

You can extend L7/L8 with authorization.
